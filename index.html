      <h2>Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Nigeria’s future leaders are growing up in a world where data is the new
        language of opportunity. Yet, our public schools are struggling to equip
        students with the skills they need to succeed in a global economy driven
        by data. Less than 10% of Nigerian secondary school students are
        introduced to data analysis, and even fewer have access to the
        technology and mentorship needed to master it.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        That’s where Data for NextGen Nigeria comes in. We are dedicated to
        bridging this gap by providing hands-on, practical data education to
        students in underserved communities. Our workshops, resources, and
        mentorship programs teach students to think critically, analyze data,
        and use tools like Excel and Python to solve real-world problems. We are
        preparing today’s students for tomorrow’s jobs.

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide data education to 10,000 Nigerian students
        within the next three years, ensuring that they are equipped with the
        skills to thrive in a data-driven economy.

        doors in countless industries—from finance to healthcare, technology to
        agriculture.
